## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#command option iis the automatic command for insert R (or you can type in all the '''{r})

x= 2+3
y=x*2
x+y #shows output in box below 
```

This is text, that will show up in the document 

you can also click the pg lines on the top right of the menu (beside run command) to list the headers of the document 
# title 
main uses one hash
## subtitle 
### subsubtitle 
add more for more sections, all show up on the side bar to the right now, able to click for easy navigating of document

# Error pinpointing

## Insert a chunk in your .Rmd document so that it renders even when there are errors. 
Some errors are easier to diagnose if you can execute specific R statements during rendering and leave more evidence behind for forensic examination. Put this chunk:

(trouble kniting when boxed, likely because no code in the next 2 R sections, just leaving with '' vs ''' as notes)
``{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}  
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)  
``

near the top of your R Markdown document if you want to soldier on through errors, i.e. turn foo.Rmd into  foo.md and/or foo.html no matter what. This is also helpful if you are writing a tutorial and want to demo code that throws an error. You might want to keep this as an RStudio snippet for easy insertion.

## Tolerate errors in one specific chunk. 
If it’s undesirable to globally accept errors, you can still do this for a specific chunk like so:

``{r wing-and-a-prayer, error = TRUE}  
 your sketchy code goes here ;) 
``

## basic checks 

```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
```

## Don’t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. Just don’t. That is all.
