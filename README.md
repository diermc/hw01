trying from terminal to make a change


editing from R studio

Welcome to all visitors (STAT545 instructor/TAs, STAT545 peers, and anyone else until my student private account is activated)

I got the changes into readme through the terminal with Joey's lovely assistance to verify git was working on my computer, and then eventually in R studio as you can see above. We had to change some settings and update R as i had a previous version of git that was confusing the directory. In both cases I was able to eventually pull, edit locally on my computer, commit and push back the changes here. 

Markdown I will try on thursday with the class.
