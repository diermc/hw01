## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](T04_stat545_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```r
#command option iis the automatic command for insert R (or you can type in all the '''{r})

x= 2+3
y=x*2
x+y #shows output in box below 
```

```
## [1] 15
```

This is text, that will show up in the document 

you can also click the pg lines on the top right of the menu (beside run command) to list the headers of the document 
# title
